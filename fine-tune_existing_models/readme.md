### Description
---
 Fine-tune existing model using the MXNet framework.

### Prepare data
---
1. It is recommended to use CUDA-compatible GPUs to train the model.
2. Download Grocery hazard dataset and put in into data folder in [fine_tune_with_test.ipynb](https:)
3. Download a pre-train model on ImageNet from [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models) and put it into model/<DL_Model_name> folder. It is also possible to download a pre-train DL model using fine_tune_with_test.ipynb notebook.

### Fine-tune
1. Follow [fine_tune_with_test.ipynb](https:) step by step. You can change the variables and parameters if necessary.
